# HealSense â€“ Smart symptom-based disease prediction

HealSense is an intelligent system that predicts possible diseases based on user-selected symptoms, offering clear explanations and preventive measures to support early detection and informed health decisions.

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Decision Tree Classifier, SVM)

Web Framework: Streamlit

Data Processing: pandas, numpy

Text & Data Handling: csv, LabelEncoder

# Libraries Required

pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit numpy

# Workflow Overview

Data loading:
Load training and testing data with symptoms and associated diseases.

Preprocessing:
Encode disease labels numerically using LabelEncoder, split data into training/testing sets.

Model training:
Train Decision Tree and SVM models; validate performance using cross-validation.

Prediction logic:
Build a binary symptom vector based on user input; predict disease; map numeric label back to disease name.

Frontend:
Streamlit web app collects user inputs and displays the prediction, disease description and precautions.

# Key Features

Predicts likely disease from 100+ symptoms

Simple, interactive web interface

Shows disease description and preventive advice

Uses decision tree for interpretability
